* While not necessary to download the following, you may want to in order to see an example of the use of tags, and to have enough posts to see the jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin in action. Run each command one at a time:
  * `cd ../tags && curl -L -O "https://github.com/ryancolorcafe/jekyll-theme-simplicity/raw/master/tags/{nonprofit.md,painting.md}"`

* Don't forget to go back to the root directory `cd ..`

* Finally, add the following to config.yml:

```
theme: jekyll-theme-simplicity

plugins:
  - jekyll-paginate-v2

collections:
  blog_posts:
    output: true
    permalink: /collection/:name
  blog_tags:

pagination:
  enabled: true
  per_page: 3
  permalink: '/:num/'
  title: ':title'
  limit: 0
  sort_field: 'date'
  sort_reverse: true
  collection: 'blog_posts'
  trail:
    before: 2
    after: 2
```

* Run your server and you should be good to go!  
  * `bundle exec jekyll serve`

**Troubleshooting:**
* The `curl -L -O` commands may not have fully downloaded each file. Even if it seems the file was fully downloaded, open each one to make sure that it doesn't just contain a 503 error inside. Delete the files with errors and retry the curl commands.  
* You may need to restart your server in order for your changes to take effect.
